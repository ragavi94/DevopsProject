
DEVOPS CI/CD PIPELINE USING JENKINS:

Devops is a set of practices that integrates people, process and software to deliver a better product / user experience to customers. A typical devops process consists of tasks like continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuous monitoring of the software etc. 

Here we have built a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to enable continuous development, automated build, testing and deployment for two software applications Checkboxio and Itrust. 

The entire project was spread over three milestones. Configuring the jenkins server, creating build jobs for itrust and checkboxio using Jenkins Job Builder and running preliminary tests on the built application  were tasks of the Configuration Management and Build Milestone.

Milestone2 focuses on automated test generation, fuzzy testing and static analysis of the source code.

In the final milestone, deployment of the checkboxio and itrust on remote production servers, featureflags, infrastructure upgrade and a special component - canary release was introduced into the pipeline.

Visit specific Milestone folders to have a look into the components more specifically and how to run them. 

Here is a quick video describing our entire CI/CD Pipeline and how we use it on the two different applications Checkbox.io and ITrust.
